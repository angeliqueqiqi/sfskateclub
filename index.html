	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	San Francisco Skate Club strives to provide a safe, positive, and fun environment for youth of diverse backgrounds to pursue their passion or desire to skateboard, meet and form friendships with other young skaters, and learn from experienced skateboarders who are role models in the community.  We believe in childrenâ€™s creativity, individuality, and openness to learn new things.  We nurture the ability to set goals and take risks in a safe environment.  Above all else, we strive to ensure that everyone in our community feels accepted, respected, and appreciated.
